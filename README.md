Human Activity Detection Code

This code uses machine learning to classify human activities into the following categories:
- Sitting
- Walking
- Standing
- Biking
- Stairs Up
- Stairs Down

The code uses a deep learning model trained on a dataset of accelerometers and gyroscopes. The model is trained to predict the most likely activity given the sensor data.

Usage:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `human_activity_detection` directory.
2. Run the code using `python main.py` (or `python main.py --help` for options).
3. The code will output the predicted activity for each input sample.

Requirements:

* Python 3.7+
* TensorFlow 2.4+
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
